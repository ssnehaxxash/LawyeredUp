# **App Name**: LegalEdge AI

## Core Features:

- Document Upload and Parsing: Allow users to upload legal documents (PDF/DOCX) via drag & drop, connect to Gmail/Drive/Slack, or paste text for analysis.
- Risk Identification: Identify potential risks within the legal document and highlight clauses based on risk level (risky, standard, negotiable).
- Plain Language Summaries: Provide inline, plain-language summaries of each clause to simplify complex legal jargon.
- AI-Powered Counter-Proposals: Suggest counter-proposals to risky clauses using AI and provide inline editable text that can be easily copied and pasted.
- Redacted Sharing: Enable secure sharing of documents with a redacted sharing link to send to lawyers or friends without sensitive information.
- Role Lens: Select the role to personalize the analysis, i.e. tenant, landlord, freelancer or SMB, such that the dashboard updates accordingly. The system uses an LLM as a tool to decide which pieces of information are most relevant to the selected role, for maximum utility.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#2E5266) to evoke trust and security.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F4F7) for a clean, non-intrusive backdrop.
- Accent color: Soft orange (#DCA170) to draw attention to CTAs without alarming users.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif, for a modern, machined, objective look.
- Grid-based layout with generous white space to avoid overwhelming the user with information.
- Visual icons (‚ö† for risk, ‚úÖ for standard, ü§ù for negotiable) for quick readability.
- Subtle animations on hover and collapsible insights to enhance user engagement.
